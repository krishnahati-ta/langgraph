⚡ Build language agents as graphs ⚡

## Overview

[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows. Compared to other LLM frameworks, it offers these core benefits: cycles, controllability, and persistence. LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agentic architectures, differentiating it from DAG-based solutions. As a very low-level framework, it provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your application, crucial for creating reliable agents. Additionally, LangGraph includes built-in persistence, enabling advanced human-in-the-loop and memory features.

LangGraph is inspired by [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pub37252/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/). The public interface draws inspiration from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/). LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.

### Key Features

- **Cycles and Branching**: Implement loops and conditionals in your apps.
- **Persistence**: Automatically save state after each step in the graph. Pause and resume the graph execution at any point to support error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel, and more.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interrupt graph execution to approve or edit next action planned by the agent.
- **Streaming Support**: Stream outputs as they are produced by each node (including token streaming).
- **Integration with LangChain**: LangGraph integrates seamlessly with [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/) and [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) (but does not require them).

## Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

## Example

One of the central concepts of LangGraph is state. Each graph execution creates a state that is passed between nodes in the graph as they execute, and each node updates this state with its return value after it executes. The way that the graph updates its state is defined by either the type of graph chosen or a custom function.

Let's take a look at a simple example:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages


class State(TypedDict):
    # Messages have the type "list". The `add_messages` function
    # in the annotation defines how this state key should be updated
    # (in this case, it appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them)
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]


graph_builder = StateGraph(State)


def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [("assistant", "Hello! How can I assist you today?")]}


# The first argument is the unique node name
# The second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever
# the node is used.
graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", END)
graph = graph_builder.compile()

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

In this example, the graph is very simple - all we do is call a chatbot node and then finish. Let's assume we run this:

```python
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [("user", user_input)]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1])

stream_graph_updates("What do you know about LangGraph?")
```

This will output:
```
Assistant: ('assistant', 'Hello! How can I assist you today?')
```
